## App Review Notes
This app includes a custom keyboard extension for generating passwords. The keyboard uses RequestsOpenAccess to enable clipboard functionality (copying generated passwords). No data is transmitted over the network. The keyboard extension shares password entries with the main app via Keychain Access Groups for a seamless user experience.

To test the keyboard: Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > KeySmith. Then tap the globe icon in any text field to switch to KeySmith.
