# Privacy Policy — KeySmith

**Last updated: February 16, 2026**

## The Short Version

KeySmith does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your data. Ever.

- **No usage analytics** or telemetry
- **No crash reporting** to external services
- **No advertising identifiers**

## Password Storage

KeySmith uses **no** third-party services, SDKs, frameworks, or analytics tools.
